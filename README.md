# Poker
An object-oriented Java program to represent a game of poker between the user and computer.
The game prints the players card set and allows them to pick a number of cards to remove.
Once the chosen cards have been removed, the hand is played against the now-visible computers
hand. A winner is then determined before the program loops.
